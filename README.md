# nn

A simple boilerplate code (that I use) for training neural networks in Pytorch (with Tensorboard).

`examples/` contains
1. CIFAR_10 image classification (based on [60 Minute Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html))
2. Supports Tensorboard support
3. FashionMNIST classification

TODO:
- [ ] Generating new FashionMNIST images
- [ ] Semantic segmentation
- [ ] UNet
